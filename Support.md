## Principles
1. Priority vs Severity => people don't care, ticket one by one.
1. Observations vs bug: if you can't reproduce...
1. Random engineers on support breaks the traceability, long lived items go from person to person...

## Observations
- PMs are disconnected from the impact of support
- Teams are disconnected from the consequences of their actions
- Teams are supporting their own products
- More in-person conversation instead of forms and handovers

## Questions
- How are support tickets and engineering tickets linked?
- Should we start a Kata to improve supporting support?

- Root cause analysis
